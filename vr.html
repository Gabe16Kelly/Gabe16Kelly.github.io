<h3>VR - C# - UNITY - META QUEST</h3>
<br>
<p>Virtual Reality one of the many optional courses for my 3rd year in uni that I took, I was pleased that I did! In this project, I created a small demo game utilising the Meta Quest Headset in Unity
<br><br>
You can read my report on this project <a href="vr.pdf">here</a></p>

      <p>This video below shows my VR demo in Unity, the premise of the game is simple kill the birds before they steal your chips and bring them back home.</p>

    <div class ="content1">
    <p>I was able to implement the VR system into Unity using its XR plugin and by using the occulus plugin within I was able to import my VR headest controls into Unity allowing me to run Unity on the equipment. For this project, I had the opportunity to explore the process of rigging and animating characters to be used in Unity. I decided to make a bird character for my game which has been tectured, rigged and finally animated.</p>

      <p> I have modelled and animated the birds in a blender and using a state machine I have programmed their behaviour to interact with the player. They have 4 states, idle, walking, chasing and fleeing, for each state I have created a different animation in Blender, which the bird transitions between them depending on the state.
