<h1>PROCEDURAL ANIMATION</h1>
<h3>UNITY - C# - ANIMATION AND RIGGING</h3>
<br>
<p>My final year project consisted of the research, development and implementation of an animation concept called Procedural Animation. My goal was to create a locomotion system that is more realistic and diverse compared to traditional keyframe animation.<br><br>
  My dissertation for this project can be accessed <a href="ProceduralAnimationShowcase.pdf">here</a></p>

    <div class="video1">
      <p>This video below shows the outcome of my project, the focus of the project was the animation and how the legs step with the body while sitting comfortably and dynamically in the environment.
        The spider model was taken from the Unity Assets store due to its detailed rig and model, with the algorithm being compatible across many different rigs.</p>

      <h2>INSPIRATION</H2>
      <div class ="content1">
      <p>If Procedural Animation had a final boss <a href="https://youtu.be/S36CH4cbW1A?si=O2uJp1aq43eoTV1o">this video</a> this video would be it, the second I saw it I was hooked! I knew I needed to try out the concept for myself, "How hard could it be"?
      Commonly used in many video games for simple animations such as the head looking towards an object or a hand touching the wall, I found it was quite effective when used on multi-leg creatures, which made me interested in using a spider model for this project as it allowed me to create expressive leg movements that show a clear and exciting animation.

      <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</H2>
      <div class ="content1">
      <img src= "images/PA2.png" alt="Procedurals Animation"></img>
      <p>Procedural Animation enables a rigged object to be animated using an algorithm.
      In my project, I successfully implemented a Procedural Walking Animation on a Spider Model.
      The algorithm works by scanning the environment allowing for the feet to sit dynamically on the ground while also working out the distance needed to take a new step.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class ="content1">
      <p> Through research of existing Procedural Animation projects I identified for a rig to be moved using an algorithm, inverse kinematics and constraints needed to be applied to allow for realistic limb movements.
      Thanks to Unitys Animation and Rigging package, IK constraint rigs were implemented onto the character's limbs allowing for them to be dynamically positioned on the environment.</p>

      <h2>CHALLENGES</H2>
      <div class ="content1">
      <img src= "images/PA4.png" alt="Procedurals Animation"></img>
      <p>One of the main challenges and first challenges I had to overcome was keeping the model's feet stuck to the ground.
      This problem persisted for quite a while creating very annoying but entertaining "bugs" (no pun intended) making the legs of the spider fly sporadically in the air!
      Raycasts became my best friend to fix this by allowing rays to point down and touch the floor this allows the spider to scan the environment constantly while placing its feet in the position of the rays creating realistic foot placement.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>FINAL OUTCOME</H2>
      <div class ="content1">
      <p>This is the proudest and biggest project I have ever completed, I am so pleased with the outcome.
        This project shows a good understanding of procedural techniques which help enhance the realism and adaptability of 3D characters across a virtual world, in many contexts more so than traditional keyframe animation.
        Without the use of any 3D modelling and animation software, I was able to create a very effective animation, which is transferable across multiple 3D models.
        I found this project has improved my knowledge of character rigs and Inverse Kinematics, which I can and already have been able to transfer these skills into Maya for some of my other projects such as the <a href="atat.html">ATAT 3D Modelling Project.</a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>Both of these models were taken from the Unity assets store I imported one into the game world with all its predefined keyframe animations, and imported another one with my Procedural Animation algorithm implemented into it.
      This allowed me to compare the animation styles, overall I believe the PA is miles better compared to the keyframe due to its lack of repetitive animations, it reacts well to the environment by stepping on the blocks rather than clipping through and overall the Procedural Animation is so much more expressive making for a more exciting and interesting character.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>NEXT STEPS</H2>
      <div class ="content1">
      <p>The main focus of this project was the animation rather than the 3D models and environment, although this allows for a lot of improvements in the future of this project.
        As the code is quite versatile it can be used on a lot of different rigs, this would work well for models in a Procedural world, full of different creatures and biomes allowing their models to adapt easily to the game world.
        One of the biggest benefits of my Procedural Animation Algorithm is that it is compatible with keyframe animation, so to take this further I have a few ideas for creating game characters walking animations procedurally while all other actions can be done with keyframe.
